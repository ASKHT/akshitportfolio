  about: `Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Akshit Sharma, a passionate junior full stack web developer with a love for crafting engaging digital experiences. With a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, I'm eager to contribute to dynamic projects and continue learning and growing in this ever-evolving field.

I bring 2 years of experience working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive and intuitive user interfaces. Whether it's bringing designs to life or optimizing performance, I thrive on the creative challenges of front-end development.

On the back end, I'm proficient in languages like JavaScript (Node.js),c++, etc. and databases such as  SQL, MongoDB. I enjoy building robust APIs, handling server-side logic, and ensuring smooth data flow to bring applications to life.

Collaboration is key to me, and I thrive in team environments where ideas are shared freely and diverse perspectives are valued. I'm excited to leverage my skills and enthusiasm to contribute meaningfully to innovative projects and learn from experienced mentors along the way.

Let's connect and build something amazing together!`,
